# Stackbit Nextjs V2

A Nextjs page builder, component library and data source mapper all in one.

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

## Importing Stackbit component library

Clone the `stackbit-components` repo https://github.com/stackbit/stackbit-components and place it in a seperate folder.

```
- stackbit-components
- stackbit-nextjs-v2
```

The Nextjs theme will now load the stackbit components from that folder locally.
